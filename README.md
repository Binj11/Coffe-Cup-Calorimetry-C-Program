# Coffe-Cup-Calorimetry-C-Program
This is a simple C-Program that solves the efficiency of a calorimetric reaction 
(where the energy being calculated is actually DC V &amp; A input). 
It is very limited in that it can only measure one steady DC voltage and amperage for the input joules... 
It then calculates the efficiency.. 
It is a very simple program and is designed more as a learning tool for myself and
anyone else who is inclined to try out LENR/Cold Fusion short run setups with steady DC input.
Have fun!
